## Objectives
* API Development: Develop RESTful services to manage lessons, exercises, and user progress.
* Database Design: Design and implement a database schema suitable for the requirements.
* Business Logic: Implement business logic to track and update user progress and manage lesson workflows.
* Authentication: Implement basic authentication to manage access to user-specific data.
* Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests for the API.


## Prerequisites
[Java 17+](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/17/)

[Apache Maven 3.9.4+ ](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

[Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

## Running Locally

Run tests `mvn clean test`

Build docker image `mvn clean install -DskipTests`

cd docker `docker-compose up`

## API Documentation
The API documentation is done using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/specification/).
The system also supports [Redoc](http://localhost:8088/redoc) for API documentation
![Redoc UI](/docs/redoc.png)

## Application Overview

The system contains 2 main actors: 
* Tutor
* Learner

The tutor manages supported languages, lessons and exercises. The Learner on the other hand manages their own account and can start a language lesson. 

## Understanding the system entities

![Database Schema](/docs/db_schema.png)

The system has 9 entities namely:
* User - Stores user information.
* PasswordReset - Stores password reset information
* SupportedLanguage - Stores a list of languages that users can learn. A supported language can have 1 or more lessons.
* Lesson - Stores a language lesson. Lessons can have 1 or more exercises.
* Exercises - Stores the learning tasks to be performed by the learner. This system supports 4 types of exercises:
    * Multiple choice - single answer
    * Multiple choice - Multiple answers
    * Short written answers
    * Matching exercises where learners match a pair of words in different languages
* MultipleChoice - Stores multiple choices for exercises with multiple choices.
* ExerciseAnswer - Stores the exercise answer.
* AnswerAttempt - Stores all responses from the learner.
* UserProgress - Stores learners progress

## Using the system

Once the system is up and running, navigate to [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/index.html#/)
![Swagger UI](/docs/swagger1.png)
From the swagger UI its clear that the system has 4 main collections
  * Authentication
  * Users
  * Languages
  * Lessons

### Authentication

![Authentication Collection](/docs/auth.png)

The Authentication collection provides endpoints for: 
  * User Registration (Unsecured)
  * Password reset (Unsecured)
  * Login (Unsecured)
  * Update password (Secured)
  * Get Jwt refresh token (Secured)

### Users

![Users Collection](/docs/users.png)

The users collection provides an endpoints for: 
  * users to update their details
  * learners to check their learning progress
  * tutors to view all users in the system
  * tutors to find a user's details by id
  * tutors to check the learning progress of a learner

### Languages

![Languages Collection](/docs/languages.png)

The languages collection provides endpoints for:
  * Add supported languages
  * Update supported language
  * Delete supported language
  * Find a supported language by Id
  * Find all supported languages
  * Start learning a new language

### Lessons

![Lessons Collection](/docs/lessons_1.png)
![Lessons Collection](/docs/lessons_2.png)

The lessons collection is by far the largest collection with endpoints for:
  * Create a language lesson
  * Find all lessons 
  * Find lesson by Id
  * Update lesson
  * Delete lesson
  * Create a lesson exercise
  * Find all lesson exercises
  * Find lesson exercise by Id
  * Update lesson exercise
  * Delete lesson exercise
  * Get next exercise for a lesson
  * Submit an answer to an exercise
  * Get next lesson recommendation

## Authenticating Requests
Steps to authenticate on swagger ui and access secured endpoints:

### Step 1
  Ensure that you have registered as a user from the register endpoint by providing your name, email & password.
![User Registration](/docs/reg.png)

### Step 2
  On successful account creation use your registered email and password to login from the login endpoint.
![User Login](/docs/login.png)
  On successful login you will get a response similar to the one shown below:
![Login Response](/docs/login-response.png)

### Step 3
  Copy the token from the response above and scroll to the top of the swagger ui page and click the authorize button.
![Authorize](/docs/auth-btn.png)
Paste the token into the popup dialog and click authorize then close the popup window.
![Authorize Popup](/docs/auth-popup.png)
With that all you request initiated from the swagger ui will be authenticated.

## Managing Languages, Lessons and Exercises 

To manage lessons and exercises, the user needs to have the TUTOR role. The system has two users with this role:
```
email: admin@llm.com
password: p@55w0Rd
---------------------------------------
email: jbloch@java.com
password: p@55w0Rd
```
Use any of the above credentials to login and authenticate requests.

### Creating a new lesson

#### Step 1
To create a new lesson, ensure that the language for which the lesson belongs to exists. This can be done by making a get request to the API endpoint responsible for getting all supported languages.
![Check Language](/docs/s_lang.png)
![Check Language](/docs/s_lang_res.png)

If the language does not exist then you can create the new language by specifying the language name and making the POST request.
![Create Language](/docs/create_lang.png)
![Create Language](/docs/create_lang_res.png)

#### Step 2
Copy the id of the language you are creating a lesson for. I will use Swahili for demonstration purpose but feel free to use any language of choice. Using this ID we can create a payload for creating a new lesson.

```json
{
  "languageId": "ab6e7aee-f96c-4c4e-a598-f1e5ba792195",
  "languageProficiency": "BEGINNER",
  "index": 2,
  "percentagePassMark": 90,
  "name": "Use basic Phrases",
  "description": "In this lesson you'll learn how to use basic Swahili phrases"
}
```

Paste the language ID into the `languageId` field of the payload.
The system supports 3 types of language proficiency levels `BEGINNER` , `INTERMEDIATE` , and `ADVANCED`.

The index field specifies the order in which one can take the lessons. For instance, if a learner selects their proficiency level as a beginner, they will have to start the lesson with index 1 followed by 2 and so on and so forth.

The `percentagePassMark` field specifies the minimum percentage score a learner must achieve to be considered a pass for that lesson.
#### Step 3
Make the POST request to the Create Language Lesson endpoint with the above payload.

![Create Lesson](/docs/create_less.png)
![Create Lesson](/docs/create_less_res.png)

üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ

### Creating a Lesson Exercise

#### Step 1

To create an exercise, get the Id of the lesson for which an exercise is being created for. This can be done by making a GET request to the 
find all language lessons endpoint:

![Get all Lessons](docs/get_lessons.png)
![Get all Lessons](docs/get_lessons_res.png)

#### Step 2
Use the lesson ID as a path variable for the create lesson exercise endpoint.

![Create Exercise](docs/create_exercise.png)

#### Step 3

The following json snippets shows how to structure the payload for creating an exercise depending on the task type of exercise.

```json
{
  "index": 1,
  "task": "Translate: Iam a man",
  "taskScore": 2,
  "taskType": "MULTIPLE_CHOICE_SINGLE_ANSWER",
  "multipleChoices": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "choice": "Mimi ni mwanamke"
    },
    {
      "index": 2,
      "choice": "Mimi ni mwanake"
    },
    {
      "index": 3,
      "choice": "Mimi ni mwanamme"
    }
  ],
  "answer": {
    "multipleChoices": [
      3
    ]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "index": 2,
  "task": "Match the following words",
  "taskScore": 5,
  "taskType": "MATCHING",
  "matchingChoices": [
    {
      "index": 1,
      "choice": "Cat"
    },
    {
      "index": 2,
      "choice": "Plate"
    },
    {
      "index": 3,
      "choice": "Cup"
    },
    {
      "index": 4,
      "choice": "Goat"
    },
    {
      "index": 5,
      "choice": "Table"
    },
    {
      "index": 6,
      "choice": "Kikombe"
    },
    {
      "index": 7,
      "choice": "Mbuzi"
    },
    {
      "index": 8,
      "choice": "Paka"
    },
    {
      "index": 9,
      "choice": "Meza"
    },
    {
      "index": 10,
      "choice": "Sahani"
    }
  ],
  "answer": {
    "matchingPairs": [
      [
        "Goat", "Mbuzi"
      ],
      [
        "Table", "Meza"
      ],
      [
        "Plate", "Sahani"
      ],
      [
        "Cat", "Paka"
      ],
      [
        "Cup", "Kikombe"
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "index": 3,
  "task": "Write this in english: Kalamu",
  "taskScore": 3,
  "taskType": "SHORT_ANSWER",
  "answer": {
    "answerText": "Pen"
  }
}
```

## Learning a New Language

To learn a new language, the user needs to have the LEANER role which is the default role for anyone who registers to use the system.
